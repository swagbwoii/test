  <h2>Assignment</h2>
  
  This project involves writing the bootup code for a simple operating
  system that we will be developing for the rest of the semester. In this
  project, the bootup code will be in the so called <i> real mode</i>
  (instead of <i> protected mode</i>).
  <p> A PC can be booted up in two modes: cold boot or warm boot. Cold
  boot means you power down and power up the machine by pressing the
  power
  button of a PC. Warm boot means that you reset the running OS. Either
  way, the PC will reset the processor and run a piece of code in the
  BIOS
  to try to read the first sector from the usb drive if found, otherwise, it will try to read a sector from the hard
  disk
  drive. Once this sector is read in, the CPU will jump to the beginning
  of the loaded code. </p>
  <p> Your job in this project is to implement a bootloader and the <strong>createimage</strong> program. The bootloader
  resides on the boot sector and its responsibility is to load the rest
  of
  the operating system image from other sectors to the memory. <b>Createimage</b> is
  a tool (in this case a Linux tool) to create a bootable operating
  system image on an usb disk. The image will include the bootblock and
  the rest of the operating system. </p>
  
  <p> The <b>bootblock</b> and <b>createimage</b> from this assignment will be used throughout the semester. </p>

  <h2>Detailed Requirements and Hints for <code>bootblock.S</code></h2>

  <p> This file should contain the code that will be written on the boot
  sector of the usb disk. This has to be written in x86 assembly and
  should not exceed 512 bytes (1 sector). This code will be responsible
  for loading in the rest of the operating system, setting up a stack for
  the kernel and then invoking it. You are required to handle kernels of
  size up to 18 sectors. However, try to make your bootblock handle sizes
  greater than 18 sectors. </p>
  <p> The bootblock gets loaded at <tt>0x07c0:0000</tt>. Your bootblock should
  load
  the OS starting at <tt>0x0000:1000</tt>. In real mode, you have 640 KBytes
  starting at <tt>0x0000:0000</tt>. The low memory area has some system data like
  the interrupt vectors and BIOS data. So, to avoid overwriting them, you
  should only use memory above <tt>0x0000:1000</tt> for this assignment. </p>
  <p> To design and implement this, you need to learn about x86
  architecture, CPU resets and how to read a sector from the usb drive
  with BIOS (described below). We have provided you with a trivial and
  otherwise useless kernel (<b>kernel.s</b>) to test whether your
  implementation works. </p>
  <p> <b>Note: </b>You can assume that the entire OS is less or equal
  to 18 sectors for this project. </p>
  
  <h3>Useful information and documentation</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/">Intel IA-32 manuals</a>. THE reference for all things IA-32 assembler. Get all the software developers manuals (Volume 1-3). Note that Intel documents use the intel assembler syntax, whereas you use the AT&amp;T assembler syntax.</li>
  <li><strong>pc-arch.pdf</strong>(Included). A good introduction to get you started (or refreshed) on assembler. Covers both Intel and AT&amp;T syntax.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Detailed Requirements and Hints for <code>createimage.c</code></h2>
  
  <p> This program is a Linux tool to create a bootable image. To make your life easier, we have provided you with a <a href="createimage.html">man page</a>. Please ignore the "-vm" option for this project. </p>
  <p> You should read:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The man page of <a href="createimage.html">createimage</a>, <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/od">od(1)</a>, and <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/objdump">objdump(1)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Use the included document for more information about the ELF format. </p>  
  </p>

  <h2>Design review</h2>
  <p> For the design review, you need to have figured out all the details
  before the actual implementation. For <b>bootblock.S</b>, you need
  to know where it gets loaded, how it loads the OS and what other things
  have to be setup before invoking the kernel. For <b>createimage</b>,
  you need to know what part of the executable file you need to extract
  and put in the "image". </p>
  <p> Before you come to meet the TA, you should prepare for a <b>brief</b> presentation
  on a piece of paper or on the screen. Only oral presentation is not
  acceptable.

  <h2>Project Format</h2>
  <!--
  <p>
  This project is an <strong>home-exam</strong>. Your deliverable will be graded and count towards the final grade for this course.
  </p>
  -->
  <p>
  This project is a <strong>mandatory assignment</strong>, but it is still covered by the rules for exams.
  </p>
  <p>
  You are required to implement the features described above, and they should be demonstrable on raw hardware.
  You are also required to write a report on the assignment. Your report should be properly structured, including the vital <em>discussion</em> section. The report should be no more the 6 pages.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>
    Never copy another students code or report.
  </strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Deliverables</h3>
  <p>
  There is one deliverable for this assignment: A private git repository containing source code, a written report (max 6 pages), and an empty file named the same as your UiT username.
  </p>

  <h2> Low-level Details</h2>
  <h3> Display memory</h3>
  <p> During booting, you can write directly to the screen by writing to
  the display RAM which is mapped starting at <tt>0xb800:0000</tt>. Each location
  on the screen requires two bytes&mdash;one to specify the attribute (<b>Use
  0x07</b>) and the second for the character itself. The text screen is
  80x25 characters. So, to write to <tt>i-</tt><font
   face="Times New Roman,Times">th</font><tt> </tt>row and <tt>j-</tt>th
  column, you write the 2 bytes starting at offset <tt>((i-1)*80+(j-1))*2</tt>.</p>
  <p> So, the following code sequence writes the character 'K' (ascii
  <tt>0x4b</tt>) to the top left corner of the screen. </p>
  <dl>
    <dd> <tt>movw 0xb800,%bx</tt> </dd>
    <dd> <tt>movw %bx,%es</tt> </dd>
    <dd> <tt>movw $0x074b,%es:(0x0)</tt> </dd>
    <dd> <br>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p> This code sequence is very useful for debugging. </p>
  <h3> BIOS Int 0x13 Function 2 (From Undocumented PC)</h3>
  <p> Reads a number of 512 bytes sectors starting from a
  specified location. The data read is placed into RAM at the location
  specified by ES:BX. The buffer must be sufficiently large to hold the
  data AND must not cross a 64K linear address boundary. </p>
  <p> Called with: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd> ah = 2 </dd>
    <dd> al = number of sectors to read, 1 to 36 </dd>
    <dd> ch = track number, 0 to 79 </dd>
    <dd> cl = sector number, 1 to 36 </dd>
    <dd> dh = head number, 0 or 1 </dd>
    <dd> dl = drive number, 0 to 3 </dd>
    <dd> es:bx = pointer where to place information read </dd>
    <dd> <br>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p> Returns: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd> ah = return status (0 if successful) </dd>
    <dd> al = number of sectors read </dd>
    <dd> carry = 0 successful, = 1 if error occurred </dd>
    <dd> <br>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h3> BIOS Int 0x10 Function 0x0e (From Undocumented PC)</h3>
  <p> This function sends a character to the display at the current
  cursor
  position on the active display page. As necessary, it automatically
  wraps lines, scrolls and interprets some control characters for
  specific
  actions. Note : Linefeed is 0x0a and carriage return is 0x0d. </p>
  <p> Called with: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd> ah = 0x0e </dd>
    <dd> al = character to write </dd>
    <dd> bh = active page number (<b>Use 0x00</b>) </dd>
    <dd> bl = foreground color (graphics mode only) (<b>Use 0x02</b>) </dd>
    <dd> <br>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p> Returns: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd> character displayed</dd>
